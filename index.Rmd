# Thanks for visiting my site!

This website is my first experience into web-building using Rmarkdown! The intent of this website is hopefully, some day, to be a website that can collate all the coding/statistics stuff I learned throughout my study in Columbia University! When finished, not only will that be a good resource for me if I ever forget, I hope it could be useful to people who are trying to learn those stuff!

# For now though...

You could learn a bit about me [here](about.html) or you could click the "about me" at the top-right navigation bar in this web! There, you could see my background, academic, and professional history though it's not the complete list.

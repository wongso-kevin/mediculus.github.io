# This is Jeff's awesome website

# Let's add some links

I often use [google](https://www.google.com) to do data science.

# we can also add images using

the syntax "[this is my cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)" with similar context as links.

you can add local image by using local datapath or use a web-link to anchor it to. However, if the web pulls down the image, then the image in your web will be gone

# in a web...

very rarely that you only have 1 page. you'd want to have several

note: first thing first, don't have readme when making a website because it might confuse things

to add another page, just copy another rmd and rename it to something else.

For example, after making an about page, we could link it here by using the local link [here](about.html)
